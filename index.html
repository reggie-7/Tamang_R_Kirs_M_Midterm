      <p>
        The Joker is Gotham’s ultimate agent of chaos, a character defined by
        his unpredictability and lack of a fixed origin, often described as
        having a "multiple-choice past." He thrives on dismantling order,
        exposing the fragility of society and the hypocrisy of morality, as seen
        in stories like The Killing Joke and The Dark Knight. With no clear
        motives beyond creating anarchy, he serves as a dark mirror to Batman,
        challenging the Dark Knight’s ideals and sanity. His twisted sense of
        humor, combined with his capacity for extreme violence, makes him both
        terrifying and fascinating. The Joker’s versatility allows him to shift
        roles effortlessly—from a comedic trickster to a philosophical
        terrorist—depending on the narrative. Ultimately, he represents the
        chaos and madness lurking beneath the surface of civilization, making
        him one of fiction’s most compelling and enduring villains.

        <p>Batman, born from the tragic murder of his parents, Bruce Wayne, is a complex hero defined by his unwavering mission to protect Gotham City. By day, he plays the role of a billionaire playboy, but by night, he becomes the Dark Knight, using fear, intellect, and cutting-edge technology to combat crime. His strict moral code, particularly his refusal to kill, sets him apart, creating a constant tension between justice and vengeance. Despite his mastery as a detective, martial artist, and strategist, Batman is deeply human, grappling with trauma, isolation, and the fear of crossing the line into darkness.</p>
