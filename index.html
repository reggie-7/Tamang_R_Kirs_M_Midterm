        <p>Batman, born from the tragic murder of his parents, Bruce Wayne, is a complex hero defined by his unwavering mission to protect Gotham City. By day, he plays the role of a billionaire playboy, but by night, he becomes the Dark Knight, using fear, intellect, and cutting-edge technology to combat crime. His strict moral code, particularly his refusal to kill, sets him apart, creating a constant tension between justice and vengeance. Despite his mastery as a detective, martial artist, and strategist, Batman is deeply human, grappling with trauma, isolation, and the fear of crossing the line into darkness.</p>
